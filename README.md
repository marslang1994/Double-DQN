# Double-DQN
Deep Q-learning is a effective reinforcement learning algorithm, but it usually over estimate the q value which influences the performance of the algorithm. Recently, some scientists came up with a improved Deep Q-learning algorithm called Double Q-learning, which uses two neural neteork to evaluate values and predict values and this new algorithm has been shown to reduce the overestimation issue effectively. In this project, I compared the performance of these two algorithms and showed that Double -learning can reduce overestimation effectively.
